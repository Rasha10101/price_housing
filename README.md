# House Prices Impact Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the factors impacting house prices. The analysis aims to identify key variables that influence property prices and uses statistical and machine learning methods to create a predictive model. This project is useful for understanding real estate trends, evaluating the importance of various property features, and potentially guiding pricing decisions.

## Project Overview

This notebook includes:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Import and clean the dataset, handling any missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize relationships between key features and house prices using correlation matrices, scatter plots, and distribution graphs.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Construct new variables, transform features, or encode categorical variables to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Build and assess the accuracy of different machine learning models, such as linear regression or decision trees, to predict house prices.
5. **Result Interpretation**: Analyze model outputs and key metrics to determine the most impactful variables on house prices.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following packages:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical computations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning modeling and evaluation

Install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. **Load the Data**: Update the notebook with the path to your house price dataset.
2. **Run Each Cell Sequentially**: Each cell performs a specific step in the data analysis and modeling workflow.
3. **Interpret the Results**: Use the visualization and model output sections to interpret how various factors impact house prices.

## Example Outputs

Key outputs include:

- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Visual representation of the correlation between different features and the target variable (house prices).
- **Scatter and Box Plots**: Visual insights into data distributions and relationships.
- **Predictive Model Accuracy**: Evaluation metrics to assess model performance, including RMSE, MAE, and R^2 score.
