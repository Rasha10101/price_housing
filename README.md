# House Prices Impact Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook provides an analysis of factors impacting house prices. The notebook uses Python libraries to explore, preprocess, and visualize data related to house prices. The goal is to identify the most significant factors affecting housing prices and present findings visually for better insights.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To analyze and visualize key features that impact house prices.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this analysis includes various factors like location, size, and condition of properties. 
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `numpy` for numerical operations

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Usage
Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
Install the dependencies listed above.
Run the notebook to execute the analysis.
Key Sections
Data Loading and Cleaning: Prepares the data for analysis by handling missing values and standardizing formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes relationships between different features and the target variable, house prices.
Findings: Highlights factors with the most substantial impact on housing prices, visualized through plots.
Example Visual

Replace path_to_image/price_housing.jpg.png with the actual path where your image is stored.

Results
The analysis found that factors such as location, square footage, and the number of bedrooms are among the strongest predictors of house price variations.
